Let's Implement the A star search Algorithm

A good reference video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySN5Wnu88nE>

A star search is a preferred and an optimised solution to finding the shortest path to from a start point to an end point as it makes use of heuristics.

This youtube [video]( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySN5Wnu88nE>) does a very nice job on explaining the concept and it's also the inspiration behind my attempt at it writing this simple A star seach algorithm.
